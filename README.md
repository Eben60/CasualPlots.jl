**This project is a work in progress and is in its early stages. The package name is provisional, too**

## Aims

CasualPlots.jl aims to provide a graphical user interface (GUI) to simplify the creation of plots in Julia. The tool is positioned in the middle ground between purely script-based plotting and standalone GUI plotting applications.

The tool is intended to be started from a Julia command line, providing access to the variables defined in the script's environment.
